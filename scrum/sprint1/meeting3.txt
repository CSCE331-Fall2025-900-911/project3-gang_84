Minutes from Previous Meeting
What we accomplished before meeting 2: We set up the basic website and environment and implemented some base functionality for ordering.

What we need to get done before the next meeting: We need to finish the ordering functionality and deploy the website using vercel.

Blockers:
Getting used to Agile has been difficult due to the amount of checking in we have to do with each other. We had an exam for another class this week so it has been hard to work on the project.
