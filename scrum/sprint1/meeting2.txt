Minutes from Previous Meeting
What we accomplished before meeting 1: We decided on the tech stack that we wanted to use for this project, planned out our product backlog, and split the tasks into 3 sprints.

What we need to get done before the next meeting: We need to set up the environment and github repo and start doing the frontend for the kiosk.

Blockers: We are still getting used to the tech stack and need to learn it.
